    <p>NBA 2k's wide-reaching popularity over the years has established the game as a marketable competition within the esports world.
        Esports are multiplayer video games played competitively for spectators.
        It is typically a competition among professional gamers.
        Recently, though, streamers including celebrities, well-known NBA atheltes, and lesser known competitors have also taken part in live, online NBA 2k competitions for massive rewards.
        The esports component of the game is gaining so much traction that the National Basketball Association created an esports league focused on the NBA 2k franchise in 2017.

    <p>Known as the NBA 2k League, the first live esports compitions began in 2018.
        The NBA 2k League was the first esports league to be completely controlled by a North American professional sports league.
        The teams themselves very much mirror the NBA.
        There are five esports players to a team, each one controlling their own MyPlayer with a certain basketball position.
        Teams are directly operated by NBA franchises, and they face off against each other over the course of a season in the current year's NBA 2k game.
        Similarly, the league is comprised of the regular season, playoffs, and finals.
