    <p>The NBA 2k series is comprised of twenty-three main installments along with several NBA 2k spin-offs.
        Each installment displays a different NBA athlete on the cover, and it is considered an honor within the NBA to be chosen as a cover athlete. 
        NBA 2k debuted in 1999 with NBA player Allen Iverson as the cover athlete and has released every year since. 
        The graphics and diversity within the game have dramatically improved as 2k22 marks the first year where a female WNBA athelete was put on the cover of a NBA 2k game.
