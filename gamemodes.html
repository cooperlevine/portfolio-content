    <p>A staple of the NBA 2k series that debuted in 2k10 is the MyCareer game mode.
        Described by 2k as a sports-themed role-playing video game, this mode allows users to create their own NBA player and influence key moments in his career from draft night to their eventual retirement ceremony.
        Users can customize their players physique, height, weight, hair style, race, ethnicity, and mnay more features, but unfortunately the game mode has yet to include any gender capabilities.
        Over the course of a career, users improve their players skills, participate in off court activities in a simulated neighborhood known as 'The City', and interact with friends and others users in real-time.
